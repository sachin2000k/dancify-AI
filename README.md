# Learn Dancing with AI help

Hello Coders, the aim of this Repo is to create an algorithm to help learning dance in a an innovative way.
<br>There are three stages to this revolution
1. Creating a scoring mechanism
2. Dance steps identification based on any input video
3. Generation of new dance steps

Please add your inputs in the required folders

Phase 1: Creating scoring mechnism
- Objective -> An algorithm that takes input two videos and generates similarity score between the two and also tell whcih steps or time frames at whih the dance steps need to be improved

Phase 2: Recreating Dance Steps
- Objective -> Given an input video the algorithm should be able to classify different durration of timeframes/actions in a single dance step as generally taght in dance classes

Phase 3: Generating Dance Algorithm
- Objective -> similar to generating algorithms like LLMs in todays world, create an algorithm that can take input as any audio and generate complete dance steps based on this.
